Quick checklist before deploying to GitHub/Streamlit:

- Add a small .streamlit/config.toml if you want to set server.port or enable CORS.
- Make sure the virtual environment isn't committed (.gitignore already added).
- If using Streamlit Cloud and OCR isn't critical, you can deploy as-is; otherwise deploy with Docker.
